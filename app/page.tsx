          <h1>PeanoScript: TypeScript but it's a theorem prover </h1>
          <p>PeanoScript is a theorem prover language based on:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>A TypeScript-like syntax</li>
            <li>First-order logic</li>
            <li>Peano axioms</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Because many programmers are at least somewhat familiar with these
            systems (even if they don't know it ðŸ™‚), PeanoScript is a great
            introduction to automated theorem proving.
          </p>
          <p>
            To make this introduction even smoother, it runs fully on the web,
            including an interpreter and an advanced language server.
          </p>
          <p>
            PeanoScript has good support for running proofs as programs, thanks

            . Here is an example of a proof that every natural number is either
            even or odd, which is also a function that returns the parity of a
            number:

        <CodeMirrorComponent
          readOnly

  : {k: N; parity: k*2 == n || k*2 + 1 == n}
{
  return for(let i=0; 
    let accumulator={k: 0, parity: {left: ring()}}; 
    i<n; i++)
  {
    const {k, parity} = accumulator;

    match(parity){
      case {left: even}:
        continue {k: k, parity: {right: ring(even)}};
      case{right: odd}:
        continue {k: k+1, parity: {left: ring(odd)}};
    }
  };  
}
  
console.log(isEven(0));
console.log(isEven(107));
console.log(isEven(100));`}
